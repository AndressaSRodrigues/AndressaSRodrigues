### Hi there! 😎

I'm **Andressa**, a **Front-End Developer** 👩‍💻 and former English teacher 👩‍🏫 with a unique blend of skills and experiences. My journey into the world of technology began when I embarked on a post-graduate course in Instructional Design 🎓. My original motivation was to learn how to create engaging online courses, but little did I know that this path would lead me to the exciting realm of web development.
